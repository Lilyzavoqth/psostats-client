# Features

### Run Categorization

Runs will be marked as PB Category if any preparation has been done before starting the quest. Examples include:
* Mylla & Youlla (Twins PB) has been used before quest start
* Players have over 5% PB charged
* In quests without a starting console (eg. Mop-up and Sweep-up series)
    - Any player is below 95% HP
    - Shifta/Deband has been cast


# To Do

* Detect solo mode
* equipped mags
* separate games
* detect non-vanilla weapons
* boss kill times
* CMode QoL
    - Floor names are wrong I think
* weapon/armor timeline? show unit/shield switches?
